#given network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n, also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges:
#times[i] = (ui,vi,wi), where ui is the source node and wi = time it takes signal to travel source to target
#we will send signal from node k. Return time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal
#If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive signal, return -1
