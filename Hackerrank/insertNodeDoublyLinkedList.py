#three possible cases:
#One-> list is empty (head = Null), so we'll need to create new head
#Two-> list has one element, value grater than data we want to add. In this case, we'll need to add a new node and adjust the head accordingly
#Three-> we are inserting in the middle of the list or the end, so we need to traverse list to insertion point. We will also need
#to change pointers to go to the next and previous nodes
