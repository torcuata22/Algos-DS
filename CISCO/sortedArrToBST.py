#Given a sorted array (ascending), write a function that turns it into a
#Balanced Binary Search Tree: binary tree in which the depth of tth two
#subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1
#identify middle value, so val <0 to the left and val >0 to the right
#use recursion
#identify left and right pointers (first and last elements of array) and find mid point
#use it as root of tree. elements < mid point go to the left and elements > mid point go to the right
# for each branch, select new mid point and use as root, update pointers until next pointer = null
#time complexity o(n) because it is recursive, space complexity is o(logn)
