#to delete a node in a linked list you just skip it and Python deletes it automatically

#OR position not head, in whihc case we need to traverse the linked list and find the node we're going to skip

    if position == 0:
        head = head.next
    else: 
        #case 2: the node is not the head, so we create temp variable  and counter to traverse

        count = 1
        while temp !=None and count < position: #we travel to the node in the position we want to delete
