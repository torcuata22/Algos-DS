#video game: character jumps height of k, with potion, it can jump k+1, given an array of heights,
#calculate how many potions character needs to take to clear all hurdles
#need to determine if heights > k (height of hurdle greater than ability to jump)
# then I need to calculate difference between jumping ability and heights in array. 
# Use a counter = h - k to determine amount of times character needs potion
