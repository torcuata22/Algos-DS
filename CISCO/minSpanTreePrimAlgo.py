#Given array "points" representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where
#points[i] = [xi,yi]. The cost of connecting two points (xi,yi) and (xj,yj) is abs(xi=xj) + abs(yi-yj)
#Return minimum cost to make all points connected (points are connected if exactly ONE simple path between 2 points)
#Minimum Spanning Tree (minimum cost to connect al points): Prim's algorithm
#Edges = distance between points (Manhattan distance)
#Steps:BEFORE IMPLEMENTING PRIM: Determine N (number of nodes) = len(points); create adjacency list: 
#adj = {i:[] for i in range(N)} where i is index, right now it's  of empty list which we will build it using i
#list = [cost, node] for each edge, weight of edge = distance from one node to the next, we are looking for min distance
#j = i+1, meaning they are adjacent to each other

#This first half creates adjacency list and calculates distances(weights)
